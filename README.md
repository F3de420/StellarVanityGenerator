# Stellar Vanity Address Generator

This Python script generates "vanity" addresses for the Stellar network. A vanity address is a public address that contains a specific string.

## Features

- Generate a Stellar vanity address with a specific string.
- The string can be a prefix or a suffix of the address.
- Multithreaded address generation.
- Option to save/append the results to a file 'results.txt' in the same directory as the script.
**IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended to destroy the 'results.txt' file after use to prevent unauthorized access to the generated keys.**


## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `stellar_sdk` Python library
- `argparse` Python library

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install stellar_sdk argparse
```
or
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Usage

You can run the script with command line arguments or in interactive mode.

### Command Line Arguments

- `string`: The string to look for in the address. By default, the string is treated as a **SUFFIX**.

- `-p` or `--prefix`: If present, the string will be treated as a **PREFIX** instead of a suffix.

- `-t` or `--threads`: The number of threads to use. By default, the script uses the maximum number of threads available on your computer.

- `-s` or `--save`: If present, save the results to a file.

  

Here are some examples of how to run the script with command line arguments:


```bash
python3 StellarVanityGenerator.py xlm -p -t 4 -s
```
This command will search for â€˜xlmâ€™ **PREFIX** in the address, use 4 threads, print the results to the console and save the results to a file.




```bash
python3 StellarVanityGenerator.py xlm -t 4
```
This command will search for â€˜xlmâ€™ **SUFFIX** in the address, use 4 threads, and print the results to the console.



### Interactive Mode

If no string is provided when running the script, the script enters interactive mode. In interactive mode, the script will ask you to enter a string, decide if the string should be a prefix or a suffix, specify the number of threads to use, and decide if you want to save the results to a file.

Hereâ€™s how to run the script in interactive mode:

```bash
python3 StellarVanityGenerator.py
```

## Security Warnings

- Vanity addresses can potentially be less secure than randomly generated addresses. An attacker who knows the pattern you used could try to generate the same address and gain access to your funds.
- Vanity address generators can be a target for malware. Only run this script in a secure, offline environment.
- Always verify the integrity of your vanity addresses and consider the potential security risks before using them.
